# self-study-react

This repository is dedicated to storing all the React.js code from the courses I'm studying, as well as my own learning projects and examples gathered from articles, YouTube videos, and other resources.

## Motivation

As I delve into the world of React.js development, I find it crucial to maintain a centralized location for all the code snippets, projects, and exercises I encounter. This repository serves as both a record of my learning journey and a resource for others who may benefit from exploring the same topics.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different courses, tutorials, or learning resources I'm utilizing. Within each directory, you'll find subdirectories for specific topics or projects covered in that resource. Additionally, there's a separate directory for my personal projects and experiments outside of structured courses.

## Contents

- **Coursework**: Contains code snippets, exercises, and projects from various React.js courses I'm enrolled in.
- **Tutorials**: Includes code examples and projects from tutorials found online, such as articles, blog posts, and YouTube videos.
- **Personal-Projects**: Houses my own React.js projects developed for learning purposes or personal interests.

## Usage
